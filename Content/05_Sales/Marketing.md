## Grow Fans
If someone cares enough to send me a descent email for showing gratitude for my work, I must show appreciation. Word of mouth is so much greater than sheer numbers. I rather have 50 people on my email list and engage with them rather than 1,000 people with no interaction. Don't get fancy. Present myself as who I'm.
