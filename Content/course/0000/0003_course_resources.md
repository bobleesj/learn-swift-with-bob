# Resources

I've prepared a list of resources that would maximize your learning potential. I really want you to do well because I care. I'd like to build long-term relationships with you.

## Lecture Notes
You are currently looking at The UIkit Fundamentals Lecture Notes where you may download the source code for each lesson and review. It contains code snippets and short descriptions. This document is also mobile-friendly and downloadable into PDFs and ePub files so that you can read it in the plane or bathroom. You may also use it as a reference since it supports searching on the top left corner.
I hope this document would show you how much research and preparation it requires for me to produce each lesson. Again, I'm looking for long-term relationships, so I feel great to document my journey and provide as much as value for my students.

## Group Chat
Sometimes, Stack Overflow contains short and snarky answers. Well, you are encouraged to join a group chat available for you to join through Discord. When you first sign up, please introduce yourself under the welcome channel 🤗. You may also send highlighted syntax and help each other grow and learn together. If you have any questions directly to me, I will try my best to get back to you as early as I can.

## Supporting Resources
Since Nov, 2017, I've been publishing one article per week. I've have chosen topics that would allow my students to refer to them while taking this course. You will find tons of great content. Some aren't covered in this course such as tips and my biased perspectives on learning and becoming an iOS Developer. Just like the same of the group chat, it's called iOS Geek Community. Besides that, you may also find some of my work through Bob's Learning Journey.

## Social Media
I share detailed updates with my readers and students on Facebook Page, If you are interested in my daily activity as Bob the Developer and get to know me at a personal level, feel free to follow me on Instagram.
Email List

I consider those in the list as my friends. If you are interested in my progress for upcoming courses/books, and receive great deals for joining me to build lasting relationships, please send me an email to be on the list. bob@bobthedeveloper.io.
