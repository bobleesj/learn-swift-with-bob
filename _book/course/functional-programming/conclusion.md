# Conclusion
So far, we've looked into 4 major popular functions that are commonly used in iOS development. However, remember there are a lot more functions available. I'm not asking you to memorize all other functions. In fact, there is an open source library that has a collection of functions. The purpose is to understand what's going to underneath the hood instead of being a code monkey. As you long as you have the ability to read and understand someone's source code, you are good to go. In fact, depending on your circumstances, you have the ability to create a function for your own need. That's it. It is curiosity that distinguishes a great developer from a good developer.

Recently, I've been working with RxSwift with my personal projects. RxSwift has hundreds of functions which are known as operators. Hopefully, I can make a course out of it in the future because it certainly disrupts the way code has been written in iOS development.
