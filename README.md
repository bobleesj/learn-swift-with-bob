## Purpose
As a developer whose first programming language is Swift, I've taken online courses from major platforms. However, I have been frustrated by a lack of detailed explanation from instructors. They tend to focus on final products, thus missing out the fundamentals. I was confused by which design principles to follow, and why. Soon after I've been blogging for the last 5 months, I've discovered this isn't the only problem of mine. I've received hundreds of emails and questions regarding how to write code that does not violate principles such as DRY, modularity, and readability. As a result, I've decided to create this course dedicated for my younger self. I believe it all comes down to the fundamentals which I lacked in the beginning.

## Reference
This is a platform for my students to download the source code, lecture notes, and scripts. As a life-long student, I've always wanted to have a complete overview of what I've learned. Most instructors avoid documenting since it takes effort besides making videos alone. I chose the road less traveled to help my students and differentiate myself from the competitive marketplace.

> Until the course get officially released, please consider it as a rough draft.

## Personal Motivation
I feel grateful for what learning offers in my life. It would have been impossible for me to create this course and communicate in English. I've decided to devote my career providing affordable education channels for all people globally. As a person who has lived in third world countries and also attended college in NYC, I understand, education is the way for anyone rise up and increase a standard of living and quality of life. To pursue this grand goal, I have started off with teaching iOS development to raise funds and increase my personal brand.
