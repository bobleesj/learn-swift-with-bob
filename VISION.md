# Vision
My dream is to provide affordable education channels for all people regardless of gender, religion, sex, race, color, and wealth. Since Sept 17, 2016, I've left college in NYC to pursue this goal. Currently, I have started off with teaching how to make iOS apps and Swift programming language. In 2017, I attempt to raise as much as funds through teaching so that I can start a company and work with smart engineers to disrupt the current education system.

I'm 20 years old, and I was born in Korea, raised in Malaysia, Vietnam, and the lived in the US. I'm currently in Seoul, Korea. Next year, I plan to go back to school to pursue a degree in Computer Science in the US. I'd like to study Machine Learning, AI, and VR technology. I speak Korean and English.

## 5 Years Vision
 Founder of an education startup in Silicon Valley that implements VR/AR for remote teaching experience even for the underprivileged.

## Current Focus
 I have two goals before June 1st, 2017. The first is to become the #1 iOS Blogger on Medium. Second, I try to publish 4 books and 2 courses.

> From Jan 1st to June 1st. I eat shit for 6 months. I hustle everyday.

## How to get there
1. Initiate and reach out to people, ask questions, make recommendations, offer to help, and pitch my ideas
2. Compete with those way ahead of me: `Devslopes`, `Rob Riches`, `Udemy`, `Udacity`, `Treehouse`, `CodeAcademy`, `RayWenderlich`, `AppCoda`.
3. Hustle everyday. No basketball. No hangout more than once a week. No day off. No girlfriend. More Sacrifices. More Focused.

## Mission Statement
I, Bob the Developer, can achieve anything if I show up every day, practice everyday, and improve every day. I learn to contribute. I believe in good karma
