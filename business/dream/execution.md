# Execution
I need to make enough money to a point where I build my social media followers and get to know them.

I might have to get an office in Seoul, Korea. Hire people for UX/UI designer. Video Editing and subtitle should be done outside. Front-end and backend developer who speak Korean.
Hire an assistance, where he/she can learn about programming.

## Current
Keep making tutorials. I don't need to go to holiday. Keep working. Keep building and do the dirty work.
